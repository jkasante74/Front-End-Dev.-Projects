Guess the Number

To setup code for Guess The Number see the README.md in **guessthenumber** folder.

To setup code for Personal Trainer see the README.md in **trainer** folder.

## Note

The **master** branch contains the final outcome for both the samples we build throughout the book.

Chapter progress is tracked using individual branches. Each **chapter has checkpoints** and each checkpoint code is **available on a seperate branch**.

For example, branches *base*, *checkpoint2.1*, *checkpoint2.2*, *checkpoint2.3* and *checkpoint2.4* contain code checkpoints for **Chapter 2**.
